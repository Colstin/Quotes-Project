#  SwiftUI Famous Quotes 
- - -
** Version 1.0.0 **

- This is my first SwiftUI project which uses a json data file that stores: authors, quotes, local images, and historical details on each of the authors. When you scroll through the list and click on one of the section you will be taken to a separate screen which will show more detail on the author and quote you clicked on. 
- File structure uses the MVVM architecture pattern. 
- Data is stored on a local json file.
- ForEach, ScrollViews, and NavigationLink to create the user interface
